# Reela Shows

## List and download Shows

```bash
reela show list
reela show list --limit 20 --offset 0
reela show download <show-id>
reela show download <show-id> --out-dir ./my-show
reela show download <show-id> --out-dir ./my-show --force
```

A downloaded Show contains `show.yaml`, `subjects.yaml`, and episode Markdown files in `episodes/`.

## Episode file format

```markdown
---
format: reela.episode/v1
id: null
show_id: 4zP8example
number: 2
title: Awakening
duration: 120
subjects:
  - 6AbCexample

Full script...
```

Keep every frontmatter field. Use `id: null` for a new episode. To clear optional content, use `title: ''`, `duration: null`, `subjects: []`, or an empty Markdown body.

## Check and change episodes

```bash
reela show episode validate episodes/002-awakening.md
reela show episode add episodes/002-awakening.md
reela show episode update episodes/002-awakening.md
reela show episode delete episodes/002-awakening.md
reela show episode delete episodes/002-awakening.md --yes
```

Validate a file before adding or updating it. After adding an episode, keep the updated local file. Deleting an episode does not delete its local file.
