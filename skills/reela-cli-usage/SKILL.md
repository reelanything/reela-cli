# Reela CLI Usage

Reela is an AI video creation platform that turns text, images, video clips, and music into finished videos. The `reela` CLI lets you create videos, manage tasks, and configure delivery — all from the terminal.

**You are the operator.** When the user wants to create a video, run `reela` commands yourself rather than instructing the user to run them. Handle the full workflow: prepare inputs, assemble the command, execute it, and report the result.

> **IMPORTANT — Dry-run before create:** Before submitting any `reela create` command, you **must** first run it with `--dry-run` to validate the request. Show the dry-run output to the user and wait for their explicit confirmation before running the actual command (without `--dry-run`). Never skip this step.

## Discovering Commands

Run `reela -h` or `reela <command> -h` to see available commands and flags. The CLI has comprehensive built-in help — use it instead of memorizing syntax.

## Install / Update

If `reela` is not installed or you need to update, follow the install guide:
